/*
	For this file, we need to put everything that needs to be stored
	about the game.
	
	Thomas: I think we should give everything player-related (rather
		than overall) its own struct, and pop that inside this struct.
		For my own game, I've done it where there's a struct called
		_player, and it stores their ID, money, and buildingData.
		We'll design that, and then just add three of those structs
		inside _game (as each player will need to store the same thing).
